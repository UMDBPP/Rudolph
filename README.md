2nd version of a LoRa tracker now using a +30dBm radio coupled with a MIA-M10 for proper tracking.

The system is split into two boards. The primary "logic" board contains the embedded and RF devices. The PowerPack contains all of the necessary circuitry to switch between USB and Battery power sources as well as produce +5V and +3.3V filtered supply rails.
